# Command Line Interface (CLI) for DataRobot

Modules in this folder implement various command line commands and subcommands for interacting with DataRobot services.

There should be a one-to-one mapping between commands/subcommands and modules in this folder. Each module typically contains the logic for parsing command line arguments, handling user input, and invoking the appropriate functions from internal or tui packages to perform the desired operations.
