# Shell Completions

The DataRobot CLI supports auto-completion for Bash, Zsh, Fish, and PowerShell. Shell completions provide:

- Command and subcommand suggestions.
- Flag and option completions.
- Faster command entry with tab completion.
- Discovery of available commands.

## Installation

Setting up shell completions involves generating and installing the appropriate completion script for your shell. This can take many forms depending on how your shell environment is configured. Some examples are provided below -- these are not definitive.

### Bash

#### Linux

```bash
# Generate and install completion script
dr completion bash | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/dr

# Reload your shell
source ~/.bashrc
```

```zsh
# If shell completion is not already enabled in your environment you will need
# to enable it.  You can execute the following once:
# echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >> ~/.zshrc

  # To load completions for each session, execute once:
  $ dr completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_dr"
```

#### MacOS

The default shell in MacOS is zsh. Shell completions for zsh
typically go in one of the following directories:

1. `/usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/`
2. `/opt/homebrew/share/zsh/site-functions/`
3. `${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.zsh/completions/`

Run `echo $fpath` to see all possibilities. For example, if you
wish to put CLI completions into ZDOTDIR, then

```zsh
dr completion zsh > ${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.zsh/completions/_dr
```

#### Temporary session

For the current session only:

```bash
source <(dr completion bash)
```

### Zsh

#### Setup

First, ensure completion is enabled in your `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
# Add these lines if not already present
autoload -U compinit
compinit
```

#### Installation

```bash
# Create completions directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p ~/.zsh/completions

# Generate completion script
dr completion zsh > ~/.zsh/completions/_dr

# Add to fpath in ~/.zshrc (if not already there)
echo 'fpath=(~/.zsh/completions $fpath)' >> ~/.zshrc

# Reload your shell
source ~/.zshrc
```

#### Alternative (using system directory)

```bash
# Generate and install completion script
dr completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_dr"

# Clear completion cache
rm -f ~/.zcompdump

# Reload your shell
source ~/.zshrc
```

#### Temporary session

For the current session only:

```bash
source <(dr completion zsh)
```

### Fish

```bash
# Generate and install completion script
dr completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/dr.fish

# Reload fish configuration
source ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```

#### Temporary session

For the current session only:

```bash
dr completion fish | source
```

### PowerShell

#### Persistent installation

Add to your PowerShell profile:

```powershell
# Generate completion script
dr completion powershell > dr.ps1

# Find your profile location
echo $PROFILE

# Add this line to your profile
. C:\path\to\dr.ps1
```

Or install directly:

```powershell
# Add to profile
dr completion powershell >> $PROFILE

# Reload profile
. $PROFILE
```

#### Temporary session

For the current session only:

```powershell
dr completion powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression
```

## Usage

Once installed, completions work automatically when you press `Tab`:

### Command completion

```bash
# Type 'dr' and press Tab to see all commands
dr <Tab>
# Shows: auth, completion, dotenv, run, templates, version

# Type 'dr auth' and press Tab to see subcommands
dr auth <Tab>
# Shows: login, logout, set-url

# Type 'dr templates' and press Tab
dr templates <Tab>
# Shows: clone, list, setup, status
```

### Flag completion

```bash
# Type a command and -- then Tab to see flags
dr run --<Tab>
# Shows: --concurrency, --dir, --exit-code, --help, --list, --parallel, --silent, --watch, --yes

# Partial flag matching works too
dr run --par<Tab>
# Completes to: dr run --parallel
```

### Argument completion

For commands that support it:

```bash
# Template names when using clone
dr templates clone <Tab>
# Shows available template names from DataRobot

# Task names when using run (if in a template directory)
dr run <Tab>
# Shows available tasks from Taskfile
```

## Verification

Test that completions are working:

```bash
# Try command completion
dr te<Tab>
# Should complete to: dr templates

# Try flag completion
dr run --l<Tab>
# Should complete to: dr run --list
```

## Troubleshooting

### Completions not working

#### Bash

1. Check that bash-completion is installed:
   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew list bash-completion@2

   # Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
   dpkg -l | grep bash-completion
   ```

2. Verify completion script location:
   ```bash
   ls -l /etc/bash_completion.d/dr
   # or on macOS
   ls -l $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion.d/dr
   ```

3. Check `.bashrc` sources completion:
   ```bash
   grep bash_completion ~/.bashrc
   ```

4. Reload your shell:
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

#### Zsh

1. Verify `compinit` is in `~/.zshrc`:
   ```bash
   grep compinit ~/.zshrc
   ```

2. Check completion file location:
   ```bash
   ls -l ~/.zsh/completions/_dr
   # or
   echo $fpath[1]
   ls -l $fpath[1]/_dr
   ```

3. Clear completion cache:
   ```bash
   rm -f ~/.zcompdump
   ```

4. Reload Zsh:
   ```bash
   exec zsh
   ```

#### Fish

1. Check completion file exists:
   ```bash
   ls -l ~/.config/fish/completions/dr.fish
   ```

2. Verify Fish recognizes it:
   ```bash
   complete -C dr
   ```

3. Reload Fish:
   ```bash
   source ~/.config/fish/config.fish
   ```

#### PowerShell

1. Check execution policy:
   ```powershell
   Get-ExecutionPolicy
   ```

   If it's `Restricted`, change it:
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
   ```

2. Verify profile loads completion:
   ```powershell
   cat $PROFILE
   ```

3. Reload profile:
   ```powershell
   . $PROFILE
   ```

### Permission denied

If you get permission errors when installing:

```bash
# Use sudo for system-wide installation
sudo dr completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/dr

# Or use user-level installation
dr completion bash > ~/.bash_completions/dr
source ~/.bash_completions/dr
```

### Completion cache issues

For Zsh, if completions are outdated:

```bash
# Clear cache
rm -f ~/.zcompdump*

# Rebuild cache
compinit
```

## Advanced configuration

### Custom completion behavior

You can customize how completions work by modifying the generated script.

For example, in Bash completion script, you can add custom completion logic:

```bash
# Extract the generated script
dr completion bash > ~/dr-completion.bash

# Edit the script to add custom logic
vim ~/dr-completion.bash

# Source it in your .bashrc
source ~/dr-completion.bash
```

### Multiple shell support

If you use multiple shells, install completions for each:

```bash
# Install for all shells you use
dr completion bash > ~/.bash_completions/dr
dr completion zsh > ~/.zsh/completions/_dr
dr completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/dr.fish
```

## Updating completions

When the CLI is updated, regenerate completions:

```bash
# Bash
dr completion bash | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/dr

# Zsh
dr completion zsh > ~/.zsh/completions/_dr
rm -f ~/.zcompdump

# Fish
dr completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/dr.fish

# PowerShell
dr completion powershell > $PROFILE
```
